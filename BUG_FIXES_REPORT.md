# SmartEats - Bug Fixes & Improvements Report

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. JavaScript Duplicate Variable Declaration Error
**Problem:** Uncaught SyntaxError: redeclaration of const lowerMessage (script.js:704)
- Previously declared at line 595, then redeclared at line 704

**Solution:** 
- Removed the duplicate `const lowerMessage` declaration on line 704
- The variable was already properly declared and used earlier in the function

### 2. External Image CORS/OpaqueResponseBlocking Issues  
**Problem:** External Unsplash images were blocked by browser CORS policy
- "A resource is blocked by OpaqueResponseBlocking"
- Images failed to load: photo-1565299624946-b28f40a0ca4b, photo-1546069901-ba9599a7e63c

**Solution:**
- Replaced all external Unsplash image URLs with safe inline SVG data URIs
- **HTML Changes:**
  - Healthy Garden Salad image: Now uses custom SVG with green background and salad emoji
  - Grilled Chicken & Rice image: Now uses custom SVG with orange background and chicken emoji
- **JavaScript Changes:**
  - Sample recipe images in `displaySampleRecipes()` function updated with same safe SVG approach
  - All images now load instantly without CORS issues
